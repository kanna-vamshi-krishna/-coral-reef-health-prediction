# 🌊 Coral Reef Health & Conservation – Data Science Project

**Author:** Kanna Vamshi Krishna  
**Challenge:** Lunor AI Coral Reef Health & Conservation Challenge  
**Date:** April 2025

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes and models coral reef health in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary using multi-year ecological data. It was submitted for a data science challenge hosted by Lunor AI.

The key focus was to:
- Understand long-term trends in coral cover and biodiversity.
- Analyze environmental factors affecting coral reef health.
- Predict coral growth decline under simulated environmental stress (e.g., rising temperatures, macroalgae growth).

Due to system memory limitations, only a **random sample of 100,000 rows** was used from the merged datasets to ensure efficient analysis and modeling.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn: Random Forest Regressor
- Time Series Decomposition
- Correlation Heatmaps
- Scenario-based Simulation

---

## 📈 Key Highlights

- Analyzed 7+ complex ecological datasets
- Built models to predict coral diameter changes (proxy for health)
- Explored relationships between temperature, algae, and coral health
- Found weak correlations and low predictive power (R² ≈ -0.01), suggesting complex, non-linear relationships

## 🧪 Scenario Simulations

| Scenario | Change Applied | Result (∆ in Coral Diameter) |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------|
| +2°C Temperature | TempC increased by 2°C | -0.0072 |
| +50% Macroalgae | Macroalgae increased by 50% | -0.0001 |

## 🔍 Key Learnings

- Real-world ecological data often lacks strong linear relationships
- Clear storytelling and structured analysis matter, especially when modeling results are limited
- Handling memory and performance constraints is a critical data science skill
